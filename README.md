# Bond London Gatsby Starter

This is a basic gatsby starter site for Bond London
It uses the following

- typescript
- eslint
- prettier
- tailwind

There is a page '/dev' that is used to show some of the design details. These pages only get built if the variable SHOW_DEV_PAGES is set.

This is/was originally used as the basis for a customer project, so some of the design components are designed for a particular customer, but it does show how a number of things work!
